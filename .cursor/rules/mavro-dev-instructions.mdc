# 🔧 Developer Instructions for `mavro.dev`

## 📌 Project Overview

You're helping Stelios Mavro build and maintain [`mavro.dev`](mdc:https:/mavro.dev) — a **resume-grade**, developer-facing portfolio and blog site.

This project is public-facing and represents professional work. Every decision (code, structure, tooling) should reflect **modern standards**, **clean design**, and **production-readiness**.

---

## 🎯 Site Goals

- Act as a portfolio hub (projects, blog, GitHub, contact)
- Establish credibility with employers and freelance clients
- Showcase production-quality full-stack engineering work
- Drive inbound leads via blog content and clean presentation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14+** with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** (customized theme, typography plugin)
- **MDX** for blog content (static files with frontmatter)
- **Vercel** for deployment
- Optional: **Supabase** + **Prisma** for contact/auth storage only if needed

---

## 📦 Architecture & Code Quality

- ✅ Use a **feature-based folder structure**  
  Group routes, components, and logic by domain (e.g., `/blog`, `/projects`, `/contact`)

  ```
  src/
    app/
      blog/
        [slug]/page.tsx
        page.tsx
      contact/page.tsx
      projects/page.tsx
    components/
      shared/
    content/
      blog/
  ```

- ✅ Follow **modern architectural patterns**
  - Keep shared logic modular
  - Extract UI elements into reusable components
  - Use layout components sparingly and purposefully

- ✅ Use **strict TypeScript**, ESLint, Prettier
- ✅ Avoid third-party packages unless no native or official solution exists
- ✅ Apply changes directly in the right file
- ✅ Use native Next.js features for MDX and routing whenever possible

---

## 🧠 MDX + Blog Routing Guidelines

- Blog posts live in `/content/blog/*.mdx`
- Use `frontmatter` with at least:
  ```md
  ---
  title: How I Built a Telegram Bot on Solana
  date: 2025-06-01
  tags: [solana, ai, bots]
  slug: telegram-bot-solana
  ---
  ```
- If `slug` is missing, auto-generate from title:
  - Lowercase
  - Replace spaces + special characters (`'"/&`) with `-`
  - Strip or encode unsafe characters
  - Prevent duplicates via suffix (e.g., `slug-2`)

---

## 💄 Design & Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes — no raw CSS unless justified
- Theme colors:
  - `brand`: `#6366F1` (Indigo-500)
  - `highlight`: `#22D3EE` (Cyan-400)
- Use Tailwind’s `@tailwindcss/typography` for MDX rendering (`prose` class)
- Font stack:
  - Sans: Geist, Inter, IBM Plex Sans
  - Mono: Geist Mono, IBM Plex Mono

---

## ⚙️ Optional Features (Post-MVP)

- Blog tag filtering (e.g., `#AI`, `#DevTools`)
- Dark mode toggle
- Contact form (if DB needed, use Supabase)
- Search index via static indexing (not Algolia for now)

---

## 💼 Project Scope Philosophy

This project should:
- Launch fast and iterate
- Favor clear code over clever hacks
- Prioritize **credibility and maintainability**
- Look polished enough to put on a resume and share on Twitter/LinkedIn

---

## 🤝 How You Should Work

- Act like a **pair programmer**
- Run commands and apply changes, not just suggest
- Show code diffs for refactors
- Alert if something is:
  - Messy
  - Redundant
  - Not idiomatic for Next.js 14, Tailwind, or MDX
